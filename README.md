## STL Files for Custom Bending Jigs

This repository includes four STL files used in the fabrication of custom bending jigs for electromechanical testing described in the manuscript. These jigs were additively manufactured and enabled precise, repeatable application of static bending to thin film conductive surfaces on compliant substrates.

Each STL file corresponds to a specific fixed bend radius in the range of **1 mm to 20 mm**. The jigs were designed to accommodate 6 mm wide rectangular samples with two-point electrical contacts during testing.

**Applications:**  
These jigs support electromechanical characterization of thin film materials under bending strain and can be used in:

- Static resistance measurements under various curvature conditions  
- Assessment of crack formation and piezoresistive response  
- Comparative studies of the bending stability of flexible conductive films

## Usage Notes

The STL files were printed using **fused deposition modeling (FDM)** with a **0.4 mm diameter nozzle** in **acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)**. ABS was selected for its dimensional stability and mechanical robustness under moderate thermal and mechanical loads. Standard print settings for ABS (e.g., heated bed, enclosed build chamber) were used to minimize warping and ensure accurate bend radius geometries.

## STL Files for Micro-tensile Fixture

This repository includes SolidWorks and STL files used in the fabrication of custom micro-tensile fixture used for in-situ imaging of electromechanical test specimens described in the manuscript. This body of this fixture was additively manufactured and movement mechanism was a Fine Threaded Hex Adjustment Screw purchased from Thor Labs (part number: F19MS200). The associated bushing (part number: F19MSN1P) was used to integrate the adjustment screw into the body of the fixture. The fine adjustment knob (part number:HKTS-5_64) allowed for precise, repeatable strain adjustment to specimens. For a gauge length of 9.53mm (ASTM D638 Type V) a half turn results in a 1.1% strain advancement. A SolidWorks and STL file with the complete assembly is included for reference on how the components fit together. 

To fabricate the part (2) two top plates, (1) one sliding rail frame, and (1) sliding rail must be printed. The after printing the bushing is glued into the sliding rail with super glue to prevent rotation. The through holes and hex sockets are designed for M3 bolts. Four bolts and four hex nuts will be needed to assemble to the fixture. The hex nuts should press fit directly into the printed hex sockets to allow the bolts to be tightened.  


**Applications:**  
In this work, the micro-tensile fixture was used to produce in-situ SEM and optical microscopy images of cracked thin film conductors on compliant substrates. The fixture could be used to examine other thin film samples which need to be examined under fixed strain conditions. The maximum tensile load is 19N and is determined by the strength of the threads on the adjustment screw.
