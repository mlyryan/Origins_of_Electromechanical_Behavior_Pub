## STL Files for Custom Bending Jigs

This repository includes four STL files used in the fabrication of custom bending jigs for electromechanical testing described in the manuscript. These jigs were additively manufactured and enabled precise, repeatable application of static bending to surface-localized nanocomposite (SLNC) films.

Each STL file corresponds to a specific fixed bend radius in the range of **1 mm to 20 mm**. The jigs were designed to accommodate 6 mm wide rectangular samples with two-point electrical contacts during testing. The conductive nanocomposite layer was oriented outward from the bend radius to ensure the material was under tension during measurement.

**Applications:**  
These jigs support electromechanical characterization of thin film materials under bending strain and can be used in:

- Static resistance measurements under various curvature conditions  
- Assessment of crack formation and piezoresistive response  
- Comparative studies of flexible conductive films for space and flexible electronics applications

## Usage Notes

The STL files were printed using **fused deposition modeling (FDM)** with a **0.4 mm diameter nozzle** in **acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)**. ABS was selected for its dimensional stability and mechanical robustness under moderate thermal and mechanical loads. Standard print settings for ABS (e.g., heated bed, enclosed build chamber) were used to minimize warping and ensure accurate bend radius geometries.
